| ------------- |

> ###### This project is a bout building a new website starting from the scratch for a fictional web design company.  

> ###### The purpose of this project is to practice on the below tools and concepts in order to familiarize ourselves with them:
* Writing `a clean code`, we will make this code clear and understandable not only by the computer byt also by the human.
* Practicing the basics of the `HTML and CSS`. These two languages are foundational to all web design, we use them to build and format web pages. 
* Using `git branch` to add a nwe feature to our project. It will make it easier fro us to get back to these changes in case we need to make any modification
* Using `user stories` which is a tool in [**`Agile`**](https://www.perforce.com/resources/hns/agile-development-explained-agile-developer) software development and describe it in a file called `development-strategy`. This tool will be used to understand the software feature from the end user's perspective, it describes user type, what that user wants, and why.
